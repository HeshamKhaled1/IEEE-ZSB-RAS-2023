## Steps:
1- Ask user to enter password.

2- Number of attempts to enter password is limited (Only 3 in this program).

3- Ask user to choose which motor to use or exit.

4- If the user requests a DC motor, the user will be asked about the direction in which he wants the motor to rotate, after that the DC motor will run for a few seconds and then finish.

5- If the user requests a stepper motor, the user will be asked about the direction in which he wants the motor to rotate, after that he will be asked about the angle in which he wants each step of the stepper motor to move, and then it will run for a certain number of steps based on the chosen angle until it reaches 360 degrees.
